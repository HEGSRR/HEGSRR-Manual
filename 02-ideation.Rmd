# Ideation and Research Design

In the provocation phase, you already developed a specific research question, chose an archetypical research design, and set up a research compendium.

Now it is time to develop your research plan!

Remember, you can amend your research plan later.
You can even embargo your research plan and git repository for now before making it public later.
The point is to start increasing the transparency and provenance of your research project *now*, so that it *can* be made public later.

## Develop your Research Plan

It is already time to translate your specific research question and achetypical research design, into a specific research plan.

### Reproduction studies

### Replication studies



## Project-level metadata

- Many components of the ideation phase will require specific project-level metadata.
- Most systems are compatible with the DUBLIN Core standards: https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/ 
- Title
- Contributors
- Extent: region / time

## Collect preliminary data

- metadata!
- code/scripts for data acquisition
- directory structure for data
  - scratch (not tracked)
  - raw / public 
  - raw / private (not tracked)
  - derived / public
  - derived / private (not tracked)
- file size limits for GitHub / GitLab

## Open Science Writing

- Write in plain text or code
- new sentence on each line
- stored in Git repository with version control
- options:
  - non-computational (markdown or latex only)
  - Rmarkdown computational notebook
  - Jupyter Python

## Human Subjects Protocols

- store IRB protocol and any forms or instruments in procedures / protocols 
- the research compendium is part of the data management plan
- read ahead to dissemination phase for considering privacy and data management

## Pre-register Analysis Plan

- OSF and pre-registrations
- Create an OSF project
- Link GitHub to OSF
- 

## Pilot study

- 

## Conclusion

You have developed your archetypical research design into a specific registered research plan.
You have developed your research compendium 
You have connected your research registration on OSF to a GitHub
