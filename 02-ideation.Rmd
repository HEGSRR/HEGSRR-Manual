# Ideation and Research Design

In the provocation phase, you already developed a specific research question, chose an archetypical research design, and set up a research compendium.

Now it is time to develop your research plan!

Remember, you can amend your research plan later.
You can even embargo your research plan and git repository for now before making it public later.
The point is to start increasing the transparency and provenance of your research project *now*, so that it *can* be made public later.

## Develop your Research Plan

It is already time to translate your specific research question and achetypical research design, into a specific research plan.

### Reproduction studies

### Replication studies



## Project-level metadata

- Many components of the ideation phase will require specific project-level metadata.
- Most systems are compatible with the DUBLIN Core standards: https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/ 
- Title
- Contributors
- Extent: region / time

## Create an OSF project

- https://osf.io
- Create new project
- Title: 
- Storage Location: 
- Description:  (a short abstract)

Once the project is created, you will need to manage more information about it.

### Project Metadata

- Description (from the initial project creation)
- Contributors (name, email, and permissions: (administrator, read & write, or read) and biliographic contributor: bibliographic or non-bibliographic)
- Resource type: likely choose `Standard` for now, and change to a specific publicaiton type once the project reaches the publication phase.
- Resource language: most likely, `English`
- Funding/support information
  - Funder Name (for NSF project, the specific division or directorate)
  - Award Title
  - Award info URI (web address)
  - Award number 
- Affiliated Institutions (this is derived from contributors if their institutions are formally affiliated with OSF)
- Date created / modified (automatically recorded)
- Tags (write in keywords)

## OSF Pre-analysis plan registration

OSF Preregistration resources: https://www.cos.io/initiatives/prereg 

- Title (derived from project title)
- Description (derived from project description)
- contributors (derived from proj contributors, or seperate?)
- category: project
- license: article on licenses? https://help.osf.io/article/148-licensing 
  - conservative option: cc-by attribution-non-commercial-no-derivatives 4.0 international 
  - no license: you retain copyright and full restrictions
- subjects:
  - social and behavioral sciences: geography
  - physical sciences and mathematics: earth sciences or environmental sciences
- summary: describe the files you are uploading. If you are following this guide, a statement like this will suffice: "preanalysis_plan.pdf contains a pre-analysis plan following Kedron and Holler (2023): HEGSRR Template... "


## Collect preliminary data

- metadata!
- code/scripts for data acquisition
- directory structure for data
  - scratch (not tracked)
  - raw / public 
  - raw / private (not tracked)
  - derived / public
  - derived / private (not tracked)
- file size limits for GitHub / GitLab

## Open Science Writing

- Write in plain text or code
- new sentence on each line
- stored in Git repository with version control
- options:
  - non-computational (markdown or latex only)
  - Rmarkdown computational notebook
  - Jupyter Python

## Human Subjects Protocols

- store IRB protocol and any forms or instruments in procedures / protocols 
- the research compendium is part of the data management plan
- read ahead to dissemination phase for considering privacy and data management

## Pre-register Analysis Plan

- OSF and pre-registrations
- Create an OSF project
- Link GitHub to OSF
- 

## Pilot study

- 

## Conclusion

You have developed your archetypical research design into a specific registered research plan.
You have developed your research compendium 
You have connected your research registration on OSF to a GitHub
