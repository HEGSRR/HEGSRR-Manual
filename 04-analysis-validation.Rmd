## Changes to the pre-analysis plan registration

Researchers will likely encounter the need to deviate from the registered pre-analysis plan.

- save a version of the text file used to write and register the pre-analysis plan
- major changes to the plan may require updating that document, rendering a new PDF and updating the registration on OSF.

QUESTION: when is a change to the regitered pre-analysis plan big enough to require an update on OSF?
- if an uncertainty or ambiguity and contingencies for that were already articulated in the pre-analysis plan, there is no need to update the plan.
- if alterations to the pre-analysis plan may ultimately impact the interpretation of claims made by the research, the changes should be registered on OSF. 

- in parallel, all changes (minor and major) should be identified with bold text or subheadings in the narrative of the analytical plan as research progresses. Our suggested labels for changes include:
  - 
- update the preanalysis plan
