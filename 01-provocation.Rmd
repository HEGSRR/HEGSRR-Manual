Framework for discovering and proving causal mechanisms, and extending this to consider types of research questions and motivations for extensions, reanalyses, replications, or reproductions.
Include exploratory analysis and case studies in type of research.

## Literature review

- create bibtex file for manuscript
- beyond the manuscripts: pay attention to references to software, code, data, supplementary materials
- use reference manager to collect references for ease of bibtex generation
- take notes on search date, keywords, etc.
- include preprints
- literature reviews become more powerful with open science

### Reading a research compendium

- give idea of end goal at the beginning by reading one of our finished research compendium

## Data at the provocation phase

- Avoid biasing your research plan by interacting too much with data observations
  - record / journal any empirical observations / interactions with data
  -
- view descriptive statistics and data visualization
- Save metadata

## Setting up research compendium

- what is a research compendium?
- why make it in Git?
- why make it *now*?
- Create new Git repository based on our template
  - public / private status
  - changes are tracked with commits
- Orientation to the template structure / file system
  - top-level readme
  - license
  - Markdown language
  - metadata
  - docs / reports
- committing some changes to the template
- Recommended prefixes: Or / RPl / RPr
- Choose appropriate `LICENSE` file for the work

## Conclusion

At the conclusion of the provocation phase, you have:

- Specific research question
- Connect research question to literature and to archetypical research design
- Set up template research compendium
