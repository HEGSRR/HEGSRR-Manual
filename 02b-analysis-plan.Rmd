# Writing an Analysis Plan for Preregistration

So you want a small *p* value?
What about practicing unbiased science?
What is a pre-analysis plan?

Pre-analysis plan templates were designed to help researchers specify the research design decisions most susceptible to *p-hacking* in their disciplines.
It follows intuitively that the templates address research issues in biomedical research, psychology, econometrics, and other disciplines at the forefront of discovering and addressing the "replication crisis".
The templates are well suited to experimental and quasi-experimental research designs in which the researcher has significant control over sampling and observations.

However, we have not found pre-analysis plans the human-environment and geographical sciences or related disciplines, in which many research designs integrate many different data sources with different spatio-temporal supports.
These research designs require sophisticated methods involving many researcher decisions and multiple threats to validity: therefore they require attention and detail in any analysis plan for preregistration.
At the same time, we recognize that other disciplines look to geography when it comes time to specify details about their (spatial) data sources, referring researchers to the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) or the ISO 191* series of standards for geographic metadata.
Furthermore, the highest standards for reproducible research compendia and for research data archiving require documentation with international standards.
Therefore, we have adopted the Dublin Core standard with expanded detail of the `coverage` element to describe the spatio-temporal support of the overall project; and we have adopted the International Standards Organization (ISO) 19115 standard for geographic information metadata to describe the spatio-temporal support of individual data sources.

The next sections of this chapter will guide you through the steps for preparing the analysis plan for preregistration, culminating with instructions on registering the plan on OSF.

## Study metadata

The analysis plan begins with the title and metadata for the project.
If you have completed the root `readme.md` file for your research compendium, you can probably copy that metadata directly into the top of your analysis plan.
This redundancy is necessary so that the registered plan document contains all necessary information independently from the research compendium.
Please see instructions on this overarching metadata in **Ideation Chapter, Section X**.

Some studies may contain subcomponents with different spatio-temporal characteristics, or may contain multi-level models.
In this case, you will need to enumerate different metadata values for the spatial and/or temporal characteristics that vary across subcomponents of the study.
The list of study metadata should contain the overarching metadata for the study (i.e. coverages inclusive of all subcomponents and resolutions as ranges from smallest to largest).

Below the main metadata fields, make a hierarchical list or a table of the study subcomponents and the metadata characteristics that vary across them.

For example, in a study of Social Vulnerability Indices across different spatial extents, the overarching metadata may be:
- `Spatial Coverage`: Continental United States (this spatial extent encompasses all subcomponents of the study)
- `Spatial Resolution`: Counties to EPA Regions (range from smallest resolution or enumeration units to largest)
- `Spatial Reference System`: ESRI:102003 (spatial reference system for the overarching spatial coverage)
- `Temporal Coverage`: 2017-2022 (this temporal extent encompasses all subcomponents of the study)
- `Temporal Resolution`: 5-year estimate (this example has only one resolution and therefore does not require a range)

The spatial coverage, resolution, and reference system can be shown to vary across study subcomponents by first adding a statement explaining the subcomponents.
For example:

> There are three subcomponents to the studies with varying spatial coverage, resolution, and reference systems.
The subcomponents are named: Macro level, Meso level, and Micro level.

Following this statement, specify the metadata for each subcomponent in a hierarchical list:

- Macro Level Analysis
  - `Spatial Coverage`: Continental United States
  - `Spatial Resolution`: EPA Regions (aggregations of states)
  - `Spatial Reference System`: ESRI:102003
- Meso Level Analysis
  - `Spatial Coverage`: EPA Region 4
  - `Spatial Resolution`: States (first admin level)
  - `Spatial Reference System`: ESRI:102003
- Micro Level Analysis
  - `Spatial Coverage`: Florida
  - `Spatial Resolution`: Counties (second admin level)
  - `Spatial Reference System`: EPSG:3086

Or in a table:

|   | Macro Level | Meso Level | Micro Level |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Spatial Coverage | Continental U.S. | EPA Region 4 | Florida |
| Spatial Resolution | EPA Regions (aggregations of states) | States (first admin level) | Counties (second admin level) |
| Spatial Reference System | ESRI:102003 | ESRI:102003 | EPSG:3086

## Preregister your analysis plan on OSF

Q: what does preregistration do?

As you are ready to preregister your plan, remember to update the `Date modified` field in your plan and on your project `readme.md` front matter.

When you are ready to register your analysis plan, log into OSF and navigate to your project.
Open the `Registrations` menu and begin a `New registration`.

OSF contains several registration templates.
To use our own template, select `Open-Ended Registration`.

Even an open-ended registration requires standard metadata.
Fortunately, OSF pulls this metadata from the umbrella project, including `title`, `description`, `contributors`, `category`, and `license`.

Curiously, this is the first opportunity to enter a `subject`, which will likely be one of:
- Social and Behavioral Sciences \ Geography \ (Geographic Information Sciences, Human Geography, Nature and Society Relations, Other Geography, Physical and Environmental Geography, Remote Sensing, Spatial Science)pro
- Social and Behavioral Sciences \ Environmental Studies \ ...

Following `Metadata`, the `Summary` should be a short description of the file you are uploading, simply to describe that it is a pre-analysis plan registration.
If you are updating a prior plan, the major updates and rationale should be noted in this summary.

Upload your pre-analysis plan `pdf` file as a supplementary file.

Finally, `Review` the registration and confirm its accuracy before moving on to `Register` the plan.
At this stage you will have the option to make the publication public immediately or enter the registration into an embargo with a specified end date.
The embargo option means that the registration will be locked after you `Submit` it, but it will remain private until the embargo date, after which it will be made public.

A submitted registration cannot be deleted or revoked even if it is in embargo: your only recourse for errors in the registration is to make a new registration to supersede the prior one.
All of the other admin contributors on the registration will have an option to revoke the registration in the first 48 hours after submission.

Once you have registered the pre-analysis plan, remember to copy the DOI and add the DOI link in the `Related to` section of the compendium `readme.md` file.

Note: If you need your project and the associated registration to identify specific files in your research compendium as specific types of resources, then prior to registration you can navigate to the file and edit file-level metadata.
