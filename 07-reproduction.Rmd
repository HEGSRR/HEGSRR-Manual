# Reproduction

The whole concept behind open science is that other researchers or students will be able to reproduce, replicate, and extend scientific studies after they are published.
This chapter is devoted to that epilogue: how to engage with a published open science study.
The repurposing of a scientific study will normally start with reproducing the original study results-- a process that will differ depending on the computational environment and original materials.
We hope that by standardizing a research template, we will have eased the work of reproducing the study.

This chapter provides some guidance for reproducing a study that is specific to research published with an open science workflow and conforming to version 2.0 or greater of the [HEGSRR-Template](https://www.github.com/HEGSRR/HEGSRR-Template).
The chapter essentially outlines methods for reproducing the computational environment of a prior study.
